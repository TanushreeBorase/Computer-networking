Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) 
on the Internet.

BGP used for routing within an autonomous system is called Interior Border Gateway Protocol, Internal BGP (iBGP). In contrast, the Internet application of the protocol is 
called Exterior Border Gateway Protocol, External BGP (eBGP).BGP neighbors, called peers, are established by manual configuration among routers to create a TCP session on
port 179. A BGP speaker sends 19-byte keep-alive messages every 30 seconds (protocol default value, tunable) to maintain the connection.
Among routing protocols, BGP is unique in using TCP as its transport protoco.

Route selection process
The BGP standard specifies a number of decision factors, more than the ones that are used by any other common routing process, 
for selecting NLRI to go into the Loc-RIB. The first decision point for evaluating NLRI is that its next-hop attribute must be reachable (or resolvable). 
Another way of saying the next-hop must be reachable is that there must be an active route, already in the main routing table of the router,
to the prefix in which the next-hop address is reachable.
