An internet connection to a building or home is normally delivered through a coaxial cable and/or fiber-optic cable from an internet service provider (ISP). 
--> This connection is fed into a gateway modem located inside the building or home (for home internet customers, this hardware is often provided by the ISP). 

The modem then passes the internet connection through a twisted pair Ethernet cable to a router or a single computer.

The router uses twisted pair Ethernet cables to distribute wired network connections internally to the business or home.
--> These network cables are also called CAT cables. 

It is possible that you have purchased an Ethernet CAT5 or CAT6 cable for your home internet connection. 

--> Twisted pair cables Originally, telephone and early data cables included two copper wires, one for transmitting data and one for receiving data. 
--> The two wires laid parallel to one another.
--> This configuration was affected by electromagnetic interference (EMI), radio frequency interference (RFI), and crosstalk between the two copper wires.
--> One of the initial engineering steps to resolve these issues involved twisting the wire pair together,
    which reduced some of the extra noise on the lines.


Twisted pair Ethernet cables are commonly used in LANs because: 

--> They offer multiple levels of protection against EMI, RFI, and crosstalk.

--> The lower levels of interference protection provide low-cost options, which are generally more accessible to home users and small businesses. 


--> UTP,  STP, and FTP Ethernet cables
Twisted pair Ethernet cable uses four pairs of color-coded copper wires. Each colored pair, one solid and one striped, are twisted together.
The STP and FTP labels are often used interchangeably to reference shielded and/or foiled cables. STP and FTP braided and foiled shields 
can also exist together in the same cable for extra protection against interference. It is important to check the manufacturerâ€™s description of the 
Ethernet cable to determine which interference-reducing method.


was used in the manufacturing of the cable.

--> The cables are thin, light weight, and malleable enough to install and move easily.
