CP ports and sockets
--> Ports are used in the Transport Layer of the TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model. At this layer, the TCP is used to establish a network connection and deliver data.
--> A TCP "segment" is the code that specifies ports used to establish a network connection. 
--> It does this on the service side of the connection by telling a specific service to listen for data requests coming into a specific port. 
--> Once a TCP segment tells a service to listen for requests through a port, that listening port becomes a "socket." In other words,
    a socket is an active port used by a service. 


Three categories of ports:
1) System Ports are identified as ports 1 through 1023. System ports are reserved for common applications like FTP (port 21) and Telnet over TLS/SSL (port 992). 
  Many still are not assigned. Note: Modern operating systems do not use system ports for outbound traffic.

2) User Ports are identified as ports 1024 through 49151. Vendors register user ports for their specific server applications. 
  The IANA has officially registered some but not all of them.

3) Ephemeral Ports (Dynamic or Private Ports) are identified as ports 49152 through 65535.
  Ephemeral ports are used as temporary ports for private transfers. Only clients use ephemeral ports.


Q How TCP is used to ensure data integrity ?
--> The TCP segment that specifies which ports are connected for a network data transfer also carries other information about the data being transferred 
    (along with the requested data). Specifically, the TCP protocol sends acknowledgments between the service and client to show that sent data was received. 
    Then, it uses checksum verification to confirm that the received data matches what was sent. 


Key takeaways:
--> Network services are run by listening to specific ports for incoming data requests. 

--> Ports are represented by a single 16-bit number (65535 different port ids)

--> Ports are split up by the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) into three categories: System Ports (ports 1-1023), User Ports (ports 1024-49151),
    and Ephemeral (Dynamic) Ports (ports 59152-65535).

--> A socket is a port that a TCP segment has activated to listen for data requests.

--> Ports allow services to send data to your computer but can also send malware into a client program. It's important to secure your ports.
