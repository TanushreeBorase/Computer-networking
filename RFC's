RFCs produced by the IETF cover many aspects of computer networking. They describe the Internet's technical foundations, such as addressing, routing,
and transport technologies. RFCs also specify protocols like TLS 1.3, QUIC, and WebRTC that are used to deliver services used by billions of people every day,
such as real-time collaboration,email, and the domain name system published, RFCs are freely available online. 

Software developers, hardware manufacturers, and network operators around the world voluntarily implement and adopt the technical specifications described by RFCs.
The IETF recognizes that security vulnerabilities will be discovered in IETF protocols and welcomes their critical evaluation by researchers.
The Internet Engineering Steering Group has provided guidance on how to report vulnerabilities believed to be discovered in IETF protocols.

The first document in this series, RFC 1, was written in 1969. It was soon followed by others, including those that describe the core Internet Protocol (IP) still 
used in the Internet today. RFCs started as informal technical notes and the name originally stood for “Request For Comments” but now they are simply known as RFCs.
The collaborative process used to develop early RFCs remains an important part of the IETF spirit.

Today, there are more than 9000 individually numbered documents in the series.
