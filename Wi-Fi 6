Wi-Fi 6
Wi-Fi 6, formerly known as 802.11ax, is one of the largest leaps in Wi-Fi technology since its introduction. This reading will introduce you to the benefits and technology used in Wi-Fi 6.

Benefits of Wi-Fi 6
The Wi-Fi 6 network protocol is faster and more efficient for networks with a larger number of connected devices.

Key benefits of Wi-Fi 6 technology include:

Higher data rates: Band splitting or increased client group sizes allow for uploading and downloading greater amounts of data.

Increased band capacity: Band utilization increased from 80mHz to 160mHz, creating a faster connection from the router to connected devices.

Better performance: The input/output streams are doubled from the 4 by 4 allowed by Wi-Fi 5, to 8 by 8 in Wi-Fi 6, allowing more clients to be grouped. 

Improved power efficiency: Devices only connect to the network when sending or receiving data, increasing battery life.
