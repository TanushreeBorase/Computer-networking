The benefits of this advancement in Wi-Fi security include:

Simplified wireless security

Stronger authentication 

Powerful encryption 

Stable business continuity

Enhanced security methods

Replacement for legacy protocols

Protected Management Frames (PMF) requirement for enterprise networks

WPA3 offers two versions, a personal and an enterprise version.
